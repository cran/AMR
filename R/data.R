# ==================================================================== #

#' Data sets with `r format(nrow(antibiotics) + nrow(antivirals), big.mark = ",")` antimicrobials
#'
#' Two data sets containing all antibiotics/antimycotics and antivirals. Use [as.ab()] or one of the [`ab_*`][ab_property()] functions to retrieve values from the [antibiotics] data set. Three identifiers are included in this data set: an antibiotic ID (`ab`, primarily used in this package) as defined by WHONET/EARS-Net, an ATC code (`atc`) as defined by the WHO, and a Compound ID (`cid`) as found in PubChem. Other properties in this data set are derived from one or more of these codes.
#' @format
#' ### For the [antibiotics] data set: a [data.frame] with `r nrow(antibiotics)` observations and `r ncol(antibiotics)` variables:
#' - `ab`\cr Antibiotic ID as used in this package (such as `AMC`), using the official EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network) codes where available
#' - `atc`\cr ATC code (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) as defined by the WHOCC, like `J01CR02`
#' - `cid`\cr Compound ID as found in PubChem
#' - `name`\cr Official name as used by WHONET/EARS-Net or the WHO
#' - `group`\cr A short and concise group name, based on WHONET and WHOCC definitions
#' - `atc_group1`\cr Official pharmacological subgroup (3rd level ATC code) as defined by the WHOCC, like `"Macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins"`
#' - `atc_group2`\cr Official chemical subgroup (4th level ATC code) as defined by the WHOCC, like `"Macrolides"`
#' - `abbr`\cr List of abbreviations as used in many countries, also for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST)
#' - `synonyms`\cr Synonyms (often trade names) of a drug, as found in PubChem based on their compound ID
#' - `oral_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), oral treatment
#' - `oral_units`\cr Units of `oral_ddd`
#' - `iv_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), parenteral treatment
#' - `iv_units`\cr Units of `iv_ddd`
#' - `loinc`\cr All LOINC codes (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) associated with the name of the antimicrobial agent. Use [ab_loinc()] to retrieve them quickly, see [ab_property()].
#' 
#' ### For the [antivirals] data set: a [data.frame] with `r nrow(antivirals)` observations and `r ncol(antivirals)` variables:
#' - `atc`\cr ATC code (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) as defined by the WHOCC
#' - `cid`\cr Compound ID as found in PubChem
#' - `name`\cr Official name as used by WHONET/EARS-Net or the WHO
#' - `atc_group`\cr Official pharmacological subgroup (3rd level ATC code) as defined by the WHOCC
#' - `synonyms`\cr Synonyms (often trade names) of a drug, as found in PubChem based on their compound ID
#' - `oral_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), oral treatment
#' - `oral_units`\cr Units of `oral_ddd`
#' - `iv_ddd`\cr Defined Daily Dose (DDD), parenteral treatment
#' - `iv_units`\cr Units of `iv_ddd`
#' @details Properties that are based on an ATC code are only available when an ATC is available. These properties are: `atc_group1`, `atc_group2`, `oral_ddd`, `oral_units`, `iv_ddd` and `iv_units`.
#'
#' Synonyms (i.e. trade names) are derived from the Compound ID (`cid`) and consequently only available where a CID is available.

#' @section About the records from DSMZ (see source):
#' Names of prokaryotes are defined as being validly published by the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. Validly published are all names which are included in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names and the names subsequently published in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology (IJSB) and, from January 2000, in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) as original articles or in the validation lists.
#' *(from <https://www.dsmz.de/services/online-tools/prokaryotic-nomenclature-up-to-date>)*
#' 
#' In February 2020, the DSMZ records were merged with the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN).
