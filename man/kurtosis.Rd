\usage{
kurtosis(x, na.rm = FALSE, excess = FALSE)

\method{kurtosis}{default}(x, na.rm = FALSE, excess = FALSE)

\method{kurtosis}{matrix}(x, na.rm = FALSE, excess = FALSE)

\method{kurtosis}{data.frame}(x, na.rm = FALSE, excess = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of values, a \link{matrix} or a \link{data.frame}}

\item{na.rm}{a logical to indicate whether \code{NA} values should be stripped before the computation proceeds}

\item{excess}{a logical to indicate whether the \emph{excess kurtosis} should be returned, defined as the kurtosis minus 3.}
}
\description{
Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 and a excess kurtosis of 0.

\section{Stable lifecycle}{

\if{html}{\figure{lifecycle_stable.svg}{options: style=margin-bottom:5px} \cr}
The \link[=lifecycle]{lifecycle} of this function is \strong{stable}. In a stable function, major changes are unlikely. This means that the unlying code will generally evolve by adding new arguments; removing arguments or changing the meaning of existing arguments will be avoided.

If the unlying code needs breaking changes, they will occur gradually. For example, a argument will be deprecated and first continue to work, but will emit an message informing you of the change. Next, typically after at least one newly released version on CRAN, the message will be transformed to an error.
