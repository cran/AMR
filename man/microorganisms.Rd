\itemize{
\item \code{mo}\cr ID of microorganism as used by this package
\item \code{fullname}\cr Full name, like \code{"Escherichia coli"}
\item \code{kingdom}, \code{phylum}, \code{class}, \code{order}, \code{family}, \code{genus}, \code{species}, \code{subspecies}\cr Taxonomic rank of the microorganism
\item \code{rank}\cr Text of the taxonomic rank of the microorganism, like \code{"species"} or \code{"genus"}
\item \code{ref}\cr Author(s) and year of concerning scientific publication
\item \code{species_id}\cr ID of the species as used by the Catalogue of Life
\item \code{source}\cr Either "CoL", "DSMZ" (see Source) or "manually added"
\item \code{prevalence}\cr Prevalence of the microorganism, see \code{\link[=as.mo]{as.mo()}}

\description{
A data set containing the microbial taxonomy of six kingdoms from the Catalogue of Life. MO codes can be looked up using \code{\link[=as.mo]{as.mo()}}.
}
\details{
Manually added were:
\itemize{
\item 11 entries of \emph{Streptococcus} (beta-haemolytic: groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, K and unspecified; other: viridans, milleri)
\item 2 entries of \emph{Staphylococcus} (coagulase-negative (CoNS) and coagulase-positive (CoPS))
\item 3 entries of \emph{Trichomonas} (\emph{Trichomonas vaginalis}, and its family and genus)
\item 1 entry of \emph{Candida} (\emph{Candida krusei}), that is not (yet) in the Catalogue of Life
\item 1 entry of \emph{Blastocystis} (\emph{Blastocystis hominis}), although it officially does not exist (Noel \emph{et al.} 2005, PMID 15634993)
\item 5 other 'undefined' entries (unknown, unknown Gram negatives, unknown Gram positives, unknown yeast and unknown fungus)
\item 6 families under the Enterobacterales order, according to Adeolu \emph{et al.} (2016, PMID 27620848), that are not (yet) in the Catalogue of Life
\item 7,411 species from the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) since the DSMZ contain the latest taxonomic information based on recent publications

\section{About the records from DSMZ (see source)}{

Names of prokaryotes are defined as being validly published by the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. Validly published are all names which are included in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names and the names subsequently published in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology (IJSB) and, from January 2000, in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) as original articles or in the validation lists.
\emph{(from \url{https://www.dsmz.de/services/online-tools/prokaryotic-nomenclature-up-to-date/complete-list-readme})}

In February 2020, the DSMZ records were merged with the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN).

\section{Catalogue of Life}{

\if{html}{\figure{logo_col.png}{options: height=40px style=margin-bottom:5px} \cr}
This package contains the complete taxonomic tree of almost all microorganisms (~70,000 species) from the authoritative and comprehensive Catalogue of Life (\url{http://www.catalogueoflife.org}). The Catalogue of Life is the most comprehensive and authoritative global index of species currently available.

\link[=catalogue_of_life]{Click here} for more information about the included taxa. Check which version of the Catalogue of Life was included in this package with \code{\link[=catalogue_of_life_version]{catalogue_of_life_version()}}.
