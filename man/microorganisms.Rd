\description{
A data set containing the full microbial taxonomy (\strong{last updated: 5 October 2021}) of six kingdoms from the Catalogue of Life (CoL) and the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN). MO codes can be looked up using \code{\link[=as.mo]{as.mo()}}.
}
\details{
Please note that entries are only based on the Catalogue of Life and the LPSN (see below). Since these sources incorporate entries based on (recent) publications in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM), it can happen that the year of publication is sometimes later than one might expect.

For example, \emph{Staphylococcus pettenkoferi} was described for the first time in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease in 2002 (\doi{10.1016/s0732-8893(02)00399-1}), but it was not before 2007 that a publication in IJSEM followed (\doi{10.1099/ijs.0.64381-0}). Consequently, the \code{AMR} package returns 2007 for \code{mo_year("S. pettenkoferi")}.
\subsection{Manual additions}{

For convenience, some entries were added manually:
\itemize{
\item 11 entries of \emph{Streptococcus} (beta-haemolytic: groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, K and unspecified; other: viridans, milleri)
\item 2 entries of \emph{Staphylococcus} (coagulase-negative (CoNS) and coagulase-positive (CoPS))
\item 3 entries of \emph{Trichomonas} (\emph{T. vaginalis}, and its family and genus)
\item 1 entry of \emph{Candida} (\emph{C.  krusei}), that is not (yet) in the Catalogue of Life
\item 1 entry of \emph{Blastocystis} (\emph{B.  hominis}), although it officially does not exist (Noel \emph{et al.} 2005, PMID 15634993)
\item 1 entry of \emph{Moraxella} (\emph{M. catarrhalis}), which was formally named \emph{Branhamella catarrhalis} (Catlin, 1970) though this change was never accepted within the field of clinical microbiology
\item 5 other 'undefined' entries (unknown, unknown Gram negatives, unknown Gram positives, unknown yeast and unknown fungus)
\item 6 families under the Enterobacterales order, according to Adeolu \emph{et al.} (2016, PMID 27620848), that are not (yet) in the Catalogue of Life

\section{About the Records from LPSN (see \emph{Source})}{

The List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) provides comprehensive information on the nomenclature of prokaryotes. LPSN is a free to use service founded by Jean P. Euzeby in 1997 and later on maintained by Aidan C. Parte.

As of February 2020, the regularly augmented LPSN database at DSMZ is the basis of the new LPSN service. The new database was implemented for the Type-Strain Genome Server and augmented in 2018 to store all kinds of nomenclatural information. Data from the previous version of LPSN and from the Prokaryotic Nomenclature Up-to-date (PNU) service were imported into the new system. PNU had been established in 1993 as a service of the Leibniz Institute DSMZ, and was curated by Norbert Weiss, Manfred Kracht and Dorothea Gleim.

\section{Catalogue of Life}{

\if{html}{\figure{logo_col.png}{options: height="40" style=margin-bottom:"5"} \cr}
This package contains the complete taxonomic tree of almost all microorganisms (~71,000 species) from the authoritative and comprehensive Catalogue of Life (CoL, \url{http://www.catalogueoflife.org}). The CoL is the most comprehensive and authoritative global index of species currently available. Nonetheless, we supplemented the CoL data with data from the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN, \href{https://lpsn.dsmz.de}{lpsn.dsmz.de}). This supplementation is needed until the \href{https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/general}{CoL+ project} is finished, which we await.

\link[=catalogue_of_life]{Click here} for more information about the included taxa. Check which versions of the CoL and LPSN were included in this package with \code{\link[=catalogue_of_life_version]{catalogue_of_life_version()}}.
}

\section{Reference Data Publicly Available}{

All reference data sets (about microorganisms, antibiotics, R/SI interpretation, EUCAST rules, etc.) in this \code{AMR} package are publicly and freely available. We continually export our data sets to formats for use in R, SPSS, SAS, Stata and Excel. We also supply flat files that are machine-readable and suitable for input in any software program, such as laboratory information systems. Please find \href{https://msberends.github.io/AMR/articles/datasets.html}{all download links on our website}, which is automatically updated with every code change.
