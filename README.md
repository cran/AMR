# `AMR`
### An [R package](https://www.r-project.org) to simplify the analysis and prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

[![logo_rug](man/figures/logo_rug.png)](https://www.rug.nl)[![logo_umcg](man/figures/logo_umcg.png)](https://www.umcg.nl)

This R package was created for academic research by PhD students of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the [University of Groningen)](https://www.rug.nl) and the Medical Microbiology & Infection Prevention (MMBI) department of the [University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)](https://www.umcg.nl). See [Authors](#authors).

## Why this package?
This R package contains functions to make **microbiological, epidemiological data analysis easier**. It allows the use of some new classes to work with MIC values and antimicrobial interpretations (i.e. values S, I and R).

With `AMR` you can also:
* Create frequency tables with the `freq` function
* Conduct AMR analysis with the `rsi` function, that can also be used with the `dplyr` package (e.g. in conjunction with `summarise`) to calculate the resistance percentages (and even co-resistance) of different antibiotic columns of a table
* Predict antimicrobial resistance for the nextcoming years with the `rsi_predict` function
* Apply [EUCAST rules to isolates](http://www.eucast.org/expert_rules_and_intrinsic_resistance/) with the `EUCAST_rules` function
* Identify first isolates of every patient [using guidelines from the CLSI](https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m39/) (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) with the `first_isolate` function
* Translate antibiotic codes from the lab (like `"AMOX"`) or the [WHO](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=J01CA04&showdescription=no) (like `"J01CA04"`) to trivial names (like `"amoxicillin"`) with the `abname` function

With the `MDRO` function (abbreviation of Multi Drug Resistant Organisms), you can check your isolates for exceptional resistance with country-specific guidelines or EUCAST rules. Currently guidelines for Germany and the Netherlands are supported. Please suggest addition of your own country here: [https://github.com/msberends/AMR/issues/new](https://github.com/msberends/AMR/issues/new?title=New%20guideline%20for%20MDRO&body=%3C--%20Please%20add%20your%20country%20code,%20guideline%20name,%20version%20and%20source%20below%20and%20remove%20this%20line--%3E).

This package contains an example data set `septic_patients`, consisting of 2000 isolates from anonymised septic patients between 2001 and 2017.

## How to get it?
This package is available on CRAN and also here on GitHub.

### Overwrite/force resistance based on EUCAST rules
This is also called *interpretive reading*.
```r
before <- data.frame(bactid = c("STAAUR",  # Staphylococcus aureus
                                "ENCFAE",  # Enterococcus faecalis

### Frequency tables
Base R lacks a simple function to create frequency tables. We created such a function that works with almost all data types: `freq` (or `frequency_tbl`).
```r
## Factors sort on item by default:

freq(septic_patients$hospital_id)
# Class:     factor
# Length:    2000 (of which NA: 0 = 0.0%)
# Unique:    5
# 
# Item    Count   Percent   Cum. Count   Cum. Percent   (Factor Level)
# -----  ------  --------  -----------  -------------  ---------------
# A         233     11.7%          233          11.7%                1
# B         583     29.1%          816          40.8%                2
# C         221     11.1%         1037          51.8%                3
# D         650     32.5%         1687          84.4%                4
# E         313     15.7%         2000         100.0%                5


## This can be changed with the `sort.count` parameter:

freq(septic_patients$hospital_id, sort.count = TRUE)
# Class:     factor
# Length:    2000 (of which NA: 0 = 0.0%)
# Unique:    5
# 
# Item    Count   Percent   Cum. Count   Cum. Percent   (Factor Level)
# -----  ------  --------  -----------  -------------  ---------------
# D         650     32.5%          650          32.5%                4
# B         583     29.1%         1233          61.7%                2
# E         313     15.7%         1546          77.3%                5
# A         233     11.7%         1779          88.9%                1
# C         221     11.1%         2000         100.0%                3


## Other types, like numbers or dates, sort on count by default:

> freq(septic_patients$date)
# Class:     Date
# Length:    2000 (of which NA: 0 = 0.0%)
# Unique:    1662
# 
# Oldest:    2 January 2001
# Newest:    18 October 2017 (+6133)
# 
# Item          Count   Percent   Cum. Count   Cum. Percent
# -----------  ------  --------  -----------  -------------
# 2008-12-24        5      0.2%            5           0.2%

### New classes
This package contains two new S3 classes: `mic` for MIC values (e.g. from Vitek or Phoenix) and `rsi` for antimicrobial drug interpretations (i.e. S, I and R). Both are actually ordered factors under the hood (an MIC of `2` being higher than `<=1` but lower than `>=32`, and for class `rsi` factors are ordered as `S < I < R`). 
Both classes have extensions for existing generic functions like `print`, `summary` and `plot`.

```r
# Transform values to new classes
mic_data <- as.mic(c(">=32", "1.0", "8", "<=0.128", "8", "16", "16"))
rsi_data <- as.rsi(c(rep("S", 474), rep("I", 36), rep("R", 370)))
```
These functions also try to coerce valid values.

Quick overviews when just printing objects:
```r
mic_data
# Class 'mic': 7 isolates
# 
# <NA>  0
# 
# <=0.128       1       8      16    >=32
#       1       1       2       2       1

rsi_data
# Class 'rsi': 880 isolates
# 
# <NA>:       0 
# Sum of S:   474 
# Sum of IR:  406 
# - Sum of R: 370 
# - Sum of I: 36 
# 
#   %S  %IR   %I   %R 
# 53.9 46.1  4.1 42.0 
```

A plot of `rsi_data`:
```r
plot(rsi_data)
```

![example1](man/figures/rsi_example.png)

A plot of `mic_data` (defaults to bar plot):
```r
plot(mic_data)
```

![example2](man/figures/mic_example.png)

Other epidemiological functions:

```r
# Determine key antibiotic based on bacteria ID
key_antibiotics(...)

# Selection of first isolates of any patient
first_isolate(...)

# Calculate resistance levels of antibiotics, can be used with `summarise` (dplyr)
rsi(...)
# Predict resistance levels of antibiotics
rsi_predict(...)

# Get name of antibiotic by ATC code
abname(...)
abname("J01CR02", from = "atc", to = "umcg") # "AMCL"
```

### Databases included in package
Datasets to work with antibiotics and bacteria properties.
```r
# Dataset with 2000 random blood culture isolates from anonymised
# septic patients between 2001 and 2017 in 5 Dutch hospitals
septic_patients   # A tibble: 4,000 x 47

# Dataset with ATC antibiotics codes, official names, trade names 
# and DDD's (oral and parenteral)
antibiotics       # A tibble: 420 x 18

# Dataset with bacteria codes and properties like gram stain and 
# aerobic/anaerobic
microorganisms    # A tibble: 2,453 x 12
```
