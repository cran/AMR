# 0.2.0.90xx (development version)

#### New
* **BREAKING**: `rsi_df` was removed in favour of new functions `portion_R`, `portion_IR`, `portion_I`, `portion_SI` and `portion_S` to selectively calculate resistance or susceptibility. These functions are 20 to 30 times faster than the old `rsi` function. The old function still works, but is deprecated.
  * New function `portion_df` to get all portions of S, I and R of a data set with antibiotic columns, with support for grouped variables
* **BREAKING**: the methodology for determining first weighted isolates was changed. The antibiotics that are compared between isolates (call *key antibiotics*) to include more first isolates (afterwards called first *weighted* isolates) are now as follows:
  * Universal: amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavlanic acid, cefuroxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin,  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
  * Gram-positive: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, erythromycin, oxacillin, rifampicin
  * Gram-negative: gentamicin, tobramycin, colistin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, meropenem
* Support for `ggplot2`
  * New functions `geom_rsi`, `facet_rsi`, `scale_y_percent`, `scale_rsi_colours` and `theme_rsi`
  * New wrapper function `ggplot_rsi` to apply all above functions on a data set:
    * `septic_patients %>% select(tobr, gent) %>% ggplot_rsi` will show portions of S, I and R immediately in a pretty plot
    * Support for grouped variables, see `?ggplot_rsi`
* Determining bacterial ID:
  * New functions `as.bactid` and `is.bactid` to transform/ look up microbial ID's.
  * The existing function `guess_bactid` is now an alias of `as.bactid`
  * New Becker classification for *Staphylococcus* to categorise them into Coagulase Negative *Staphylococci* (CoNS) and Coagulase Positve *Staphylococci* (CoPS)
  * New Lancefield classification for *Streptococcus* to categorise them into Lancefield groups
* For convience, new descriptive statistical functions `kurtosis` and `skewness` that are lacking in base R - they are generic functions and have support for vectors, data.frames and matrices
* Function `g.test` to perform the Î§<sup>2</sup> distributed [*G*-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-test), which use is the same as `chisq.test`
* Function `ratio` to transform a vector of values to a preset ratio
  * For example: `ratio(c(10, 500, 10), ratio = "1:2:1")` would return `130, 260, 130`
* Support for Addins menu in RStudio to quickly insert `%in%` or `%like%` (and give them keyboard shortcuts), or to view the datasets that come with this package
* Function `p.symbol` to transform p values to their related symbols: `0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1`
* Functions `clipboard_import` and `clipboard_export` as helper functions to quickly copy and paste from/to software like Excel and SPSS. These functions use the `clipr` package, but are a little altered to also support headless Linux servers (so you can use it in RStudio Server)
* New for frequency tables (function `freq`):
  * A vignette to explain its usage
  * Support for `rsi` (antimicrobial resistance) to use as input
  * Support for `table` to use as input: `freq(table(x, y))`
  * Support for existing functions `hist` and `plot` to use a frequency table as input: `hist(freq(df$age))`
  * Support for `as.vector`, `as.data.frame`, `as_tibble` and `format`
  * Support for quasiquotation: `freq(mydata, mycolumn)` is the same as `mydata %>% freq(mycolumn)`
  * Function `top_freq` function to return the top/below *n* items as vector
  * Header of frequency tables now also show Mean Absolute Deviaton (MAD) and Interquartile Range (IQR)
  * Possibility to globally set the default for the amount of items to print, with `options(max.print.freq = n)` where *n* is your preset value

#### Changed
* Improvements for forecasting with `resistance_predict` and added more examples
* More antibiotics added as parameters for EUCAST rules
* Updated version of the `septic_patients` data set to better reflect the reality
* Pretty printing for tibbles removed as it is not really the scope of this package
* Printing of `mic` and `rsi` classes now returns all values - use `freq` to check distributions
* Improved speed of key antibiotics comparison for determining first isolates
* Column names for the `key_antibiotics` function are now generic: 6 for broadspectrum ABs, 6 for Gram-positive specific and 6 for Gram-negative specific ABs
* Speed improvement for the `abname` function
* `%like%` now supports multiple patterns
* Frequency tables are now actual `data.frame`s with altered console printing to make it look like a frequency table. Because of this, the parameter `toConsole` is not longer needed.
* Fix for `freq` where the class of an item would be lost
* Small translational improvements to the `septic_patients` dataset and the column `bactid` now has the new class `"bactid"`
* Small improvements to the `microorganisms` dataset (especially for *Salmonella*) and the column `bactid` now has the new class `"bactid"`
* Combined MIC/RSI values will now be coerced by the `rsi` and `mic` functions:
  * `as.rsi("<=0.002; S")` will return `S`
  * `as.mic("<=0.002; S")` will return `<=0.002`
* Now possible to coerce MIC values with a space between operator and value, i.e. `as.mic("<= 0.002")` now works
* Classes `rsi` and `mic` do not add the attribute `package.version` anymore
* Added `"groups"` option for `atc_property(..., property)`. It will return a vector of the ATC hierarchy as defined by the [WHO](https://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/). The new function `atc_groups` is a convenient wrapper around this.
* Build-in host check for `atc_property` as it requires the host set by `url` to be responsive
* Improved `first_isolate` algorithm to exclude isolates where bacteria ID or genus is unavailable
* Fix for warning *hybrid evaluation forced for row_number* ([`924b62`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/commit/924b62)) from the `dplyr` package v0.7.5 and above
* Support for empty values and for 1 or 2 columns as input for `guess_bactid` (now called `as.bactid`)
  * So `yourdata %>% select(genus, species) %>% as.bactid()` now also works
* Other small fixes

  * Linux and macOS: https://travis-ci.org/msberends/AMR
  * Windows: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/msberends/amr
* Added thesis advisors to DESCRIPTION file
