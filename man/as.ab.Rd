\title{Transform Input to an Antibiotic ID}
\usage{
as.ab(x, flag_multiple_results = TRUE, info = TRUE, ...)

is.ab(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character vector to determine to antibiotic ID}

\item{flag_multiple_results}{logical to indicate whether a note should be printed to the console that probably more than one antibiotic code or name can be retrieved from a single input value.}

\item{info}{logical to indicate whether a progress bar should be printed}

\item{...}{arguments passed on to internal functions}
}
\value{
A \link{character} \link{vector} with additional class \code{\link{ab}}
}
\description{
Use this function to determine the antibiotic code of one or more antibiotics. The data set \link{antibiotics} will be searched for abbreviations, official names and synonyms (brand names).
}
\details{
All entries in the \link{antibiotics} data set have three different identifiers: a human readable EARS-Net code (column \code{ab}, used by ECDC and WHONET), an ATC code (column \code{atc}, used by WHO), and a CID code (column \code{cid}, Compound ID, used by PubChem). The data set contains more than 5,000 official brand names from many different countries, as found in PubChem.

All these properties will be searched for the user input. The \code{\link[=as.ab]{as.ab()}} can correct for different forms of misspelling:
\itemize{
\item Wrong spelling of drug names (such as "tobramicin" or "gentamycin"), which corrects for most audible similarities such as f/ph, x/ks, c/z/s, t/th, etc.
\item Too few or too many vowels or consonants
\item Switching two characters (such as "mreopenem", often the case in clinical data, when doctors typed too fast)
\item Digitalised paper records, leaving artefacts like 0/o/O (zero and O's), B/8, n/r, etc.
}

Use the \code{\link[=ab_property]{ab_*}} functions to get properties based on the returned antibiotic ID, see \emph{Examples}.

Note: the \code{\link[=as.ab]{as.ab()}} and \code{\link[=ab_property]{ab_*}} functions may use very long regular expression to match brand names of antimicrobial agents. This may fail on some systems.

\section{Stable Lifecycle}{

\if{html}{\figure{lifecycle_stable.svg}{options: style=margin-bottom:5px} \cr}
The \link[=lifecycle]{lifecycle} of this function is \strong{stable}. In a stable function, major changes are unlikely. This means that the unlying code will generally evolve by adding new arguments; removing arguments or changing the meaning of existing arguments will be avoided.

If the unlying code needs breaking changes, they will occur gradually. For example, a argument will be deprecated and first continue to work, but will emit an message informing you of the change. Next, typically after at least one newly released version on CRAN, the message will be transformed to an error.

This package contains \strong{all ~550 antibiotic, antimycotic and antiviral drugs} and their Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes, ATC groups and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC, \url{https://www.whocc.no}) and the Pharmaceuticals Community Register of the European Commission (\url{http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/community-register/html/atc.htm}).

These have become the gold standard for international drug utilisation monitoring and research.

The WHOCC is located in Oslo at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and funded by the Norwegian government. The European Commission is the executive of the European Union and promotes its general interest.

All reference data sets (about microorganisms, antibiotics, R/SI interpretation, EUCAST rules, etc.) in this \code{AMR} package are publicly and freely available. We continually export our data sets to formats for use in R, SPSS, SAS, Stata and Excel. We also supply flat files that are machine-readable and suitable for input in any software program, such as laboratory information systems.

ab_atc("cephtriaxone")     # small spelling error
ab_atc("cephthriaxone")    # or a bit more severe
ab_atc("seephthriaaksone") # and even this works

# use ab_* functions to get a specific properties (see ?ab_property);
# they use as.ab() internally:
ab_name("J01FA01")    # "Erythromycin"
ab_name("eryt")       # "Erythromycin"
