\title{Deprecated Functions}
\description{
These functions are so-called '\link{Deprecated}'. \strong{They will be removed in a future release.} Using the functions will give a warning with the name of the function it has been replaced by (if there is one).

\if{html}{\figure{lifecycle_retired.svg}{options: style=margin-bottom:5px} \cr}
The \link[=lifecycle]{lifecycle} of this function is \strong{retired}. A retired function is no longer under active development, and (if appropiate) a better alternative is available. No new arguments will be added, and only the most critical bugs will be fixed. In a future version, this function will be removed.
